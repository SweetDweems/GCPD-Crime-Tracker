GCPD Tracker System 
===
This is my finished code for Phase 5 of the Gotham City Police Department Tracker System.  This project was assigned in the fall of 2018 as a 67-272 project at Carnegie Mellon University, Information Systems department.  More information about the project can be found at [67272.cmuis.net](https://67272.cmuis.net).

Populating the dev database
---
You can populate the development database with a decent number of fictitious records with the command `rake db:populate`.  There are over 50 investigations generated, but only one is initially closed.

There is also a large set of criminals generated this time around, including many from Batman's famous 'Rogues Gallery'. Great reading and worth formatting appropriately.
